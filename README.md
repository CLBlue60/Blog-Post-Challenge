# Blog-Post-Challenge

## Description 
This project is a simple personal blog application where users can create blog posts and view them. Users are able to submit titled blogs under unique usernames. After submitting the blog on the following page, all locally submitted blogs are listed. There is a dark/light toggle button on both pages, and a back button on the page of listed blogs to take the user back to the main page.
